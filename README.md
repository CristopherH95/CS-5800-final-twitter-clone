# CS-5800 Final: Twitter Clone UML

This repository contains a class UML diagram describing the implementation of a basic Twitter clone. This clone implements the following features:

- User registration
- Posting Tweets with text, images, and video
- Notification on new posts, follows, and likes
- Liking posts
- Following users and topics ("hashtags")
- Blocking users

In order to accomplish this, several design patterns are used. These patterns are:

- Singleton
- Builder
- Abstract factory
- Mediator
- Observer
- Iterator

The diagram can be viewed at `diagram.png`, and it was created using PlantUML. The original source for the diagram is contained in `twitter-clone.txt`.
